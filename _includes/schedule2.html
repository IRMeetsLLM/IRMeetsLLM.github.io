                  <li>Abstract: Vector data is becoming ubiquitous in the era of deep learning and generative AI. A fundamental operator on vector data is the approximate K nearest neighbor (AKNN) search, which retrieves from a database of vectors those that are close to a query vector. AKNN has also been used as a popular information retrieval method. Many algorithms have been developed for AKNN. We observe that in high-dimensional space, the time consumption of nearly all AKNN algorithms is dominated by that of the distance comparison operations (DCOs). For each operation, it scans full dimensions of an object and thus, runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. In this talk, I will introduce a new randomized algorithm named ADSampling which runs in logarithmic time wrt to the dimensionality for the majority of DCOs and succeeds with high probability. In addition, I will introduce one general and two algorithm-specific techniques based on ADSampling, which can be used as plugins to enhance existing AKNN algorithms. I will also briefly introduce a new quantization method for high-dimensional vectors, which can be used for enhancing the efficiency of AKNN, and finally discuss some future research directions of AKNN.</li>
                  <li>Bio: Cheng LONG is an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU). He earned his Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2015 and his Bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology (SCUT) in 2010. He has research interests broadly in data management and data mining. Specifically, he works in high-dimensional vector data management (and its applications in large models such as retrieval-augmented generative AI), spatial data management with machine learning-based techniques, spatial data mining in the urban domain (e.g., traffic and mobility analysis), and graph data mining (including dense subgraph mining and graphlet mining). His work has garnered recognition and accolades, including the prestigious "Best Research Award" from ACM-Hong Kong, the "Fulbright-RGC Research Award" granted by the Research Grant Council (Hong Kong), the "PG Paper Contest Award" bestowed by IEEE-HK, and the "Overseas Research Award" received from HKUST.</li>
