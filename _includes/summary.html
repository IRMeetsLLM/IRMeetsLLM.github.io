                      The advent of large language models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges for the information retrieval (IR) community. On one hand, LLMs will revolutionize how people access information, meanwhile the retrieval techniques can play a crucial role in addressing many inherent limitations of LLMs. On the other hand, there are open problems regarding the collaboration of retrieval and generation, the potential risks of misinformation, and the concerns about cost-effectiveness. To seize the critical moment for development, it calls for the joint effort from academia and industry on many key issues, including identification of new research problems, proposal of new techniques, and creation of new evaluation protocols. It has been one year since the launch of ChatGPT in November last year, and the entire community is currently undergoing a profound transformation in techniques. Therefore, this workshop will be a timely venue to exchange ideas and forge collaborations.
