content-speak: The advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have given rise to a new paradigm in recommendation, known as LLM4Rec. However, due to limitations such as the lack of recommendation related data in the pre-training corpus of LLM, LLMs are not naturally suitable for recommendation. The key to resolving this issue lies in aligning LLMs with recommendations by instruction tuning. Specifically, we will delve into exploring how to unleash the potential of LLMs in the field of the recommendation by focusing on aligning LLMs with both the recommendation task and the recommendation modality. Finally, we shall contemplate the potential concerns posited by LLM4Rec, as well as envision the prospects that LLM4Rec hold.
